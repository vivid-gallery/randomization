# Golden Ratio Randomization

Golden Ratio artworks that have been sold during the presale or airdropped to SATs holders need to be randomized to provide fair chances for everyone.

To do that every buyer will be assigned a number (or multiple numbers if you bought more than one), then the numbers will be shifted by random number.

The random number that will be used will be determined by a seed random number generator (seedrandom package on npm).

The seed that will be used will be the blockhash of an announced Bitcoin block. This ensure that the seed is random since there is no possibility for us to know the blockhash in advance nor to influence the blockhash of a certain block.

Please check (Twitter/X)[https://twitter.com/vivid_ordinals] or (Discord)[discord.gg/g6GM8Jd2] for the block number.
